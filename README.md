# The Go Programming Language

This repository provides the downloadable example programs for the book, "The Go Programming Language"; see [http://www.gopl.io](http://www.gopl.io).

These example programs are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).  
 

You can download, build, and run the programs with the following commands:

```text
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/gobook            # choose workspace directory
$ go get gopl.io/ch1/helloworld         # fetch, build, install
$ $GOPATH/bin/helloworld                # run
Hello, 世界
```

Many of the programs contain comments of the form `//!+` and `//!-`. These comments bracket the parts of the programs that are excerpted in the book; you can safely ignore them. In a few cases, programs have been reformatted in an unnatural way so that they can be presented in stages in the book.
